## 📌 Topic-Sensitive PageRank for Personalized Web Search

This project explores **Topic-Sensitive PageRank (TSPR)** as an extension of the classic PageRank algorithm to support personalized web search. By biasing the teleportation vector based on topic relevance, TSPR delivers more user-aligned search results.

### 🔍 Features

* Implementation of TSPR using Python and NetworkX
* Biased random walks on a web graph with topic-specific teleportation vectors
* Support for user profile-based personalization
* Comparative evaluation against traditional PageRank using Spearman and Jaccard metrics

### 📊 Results

TSPR outperforms standard PageRank in delivering topic-relevant content, with statistically significant improvements in correlation with user preferences.

### 📚 Applications

* Personalized search engines (e.g., Google, Bing)
* News and content recommendation systems
* Academic search and e-learning platforms

### 🧠 Future Work

* Scalability through topic clustering and matrix approximation
* Integration with BERT for topic inference and dynamic personalization
* Enhancement using Graph Neural Networks
